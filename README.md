# Highlights
- Have used react default state/setState for the state management 
- Focussed on modularity
- The design is responsive.
- Have used react-promise-tracker to handle loader visibilty for async calls
- Have used scss and it's features like extend, variables, partials etc
- All the async calls related functions are written in the seprate file

# NOTE: 
- This project could have also been done using redux or context-api for state management. I have good understanding of both the concepts.
